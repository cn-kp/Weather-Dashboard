## Description

This application is created to aid the user in finding weather forecast information for the next 5 days for a particular city. The user is required to enter a city that they want weather information on and the page will respond by fetching the required API and displaying the forecast on the page.

Upon clicking the search icon, the city will also be appended to the history tab just below the search bar, allowing the user to quickly research that city. If the history is no longer needed, the user also has the option to clear all local history through the button beneath the history named "clear history" 

The program is simplistic and intuitive to use.
